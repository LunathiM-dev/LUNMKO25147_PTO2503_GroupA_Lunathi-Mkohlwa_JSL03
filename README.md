# JSL03 Project Brief: Console-Based Task Manager
Iâ€™m creating a simple task tracker. The program asks the user for task details (title, description, and status). Each task is stored as an object inside an array. The program then filters out tasks that are marked as done and displays them in the console. If there are no completed tasks, it shows a motivational message instead.
